# Hello World
This is a sample plugin built for Mautic 3 on the now included IntegrationsBundle. The documentation remains the same as the [Integrations plugin](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-integrations) with the exception that the namespace `MauticPlugin\IntegrationsBundle` is now `Mautic\IntegrationsBundle`.

It does not work in the UI because the API endpoints do not exist. :-) 

However, this can be used as an example in combination with the [Integrations plugin wiki](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-integrations/wiki).
